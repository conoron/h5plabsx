I have introduced some changes to the bootstrap code, normally bootstrap give you the minimum code, you must make changes, so i introduced a hyperlink to an article on the web and I made some text bold (the code below is what I started with, I changed this in the WYSIWYG)

~~~HTML
<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
  <a href="#" class="alert-link">...</a>
</div>
~~~ 

If you want to use a different color you need to change "danger" to another attribute, use one of the following;

+ warning
+ success
+ info
+ danger

Try and and take this code and place a new alert into this section
