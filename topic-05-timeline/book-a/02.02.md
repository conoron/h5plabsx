# Presentation context

This screen is slighty more complicated then previous workshops screens, in this example we are going to build a timeline of the internet so that the student can navigate through the timeline and see all the major dates that happen as part of the Internet, I will be using some slides that I prepared earlier (for the Presentation Workshop) and I will use those as my images.

## Settings explained

On the screen we see a few part that we need to explain first before we continue, starting with the Title, which is the title the user will see on the Moodle page. in this example I have called it "**Timeline of the Internet**".
