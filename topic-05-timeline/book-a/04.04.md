# Adding more dates

At this point we have two dates (1962) and (1969) in place, we will add an other date now and if you want to add a further dates its will be just a case of repeating this step taking in account what you have learner about sourcing images and also how to crete new dates.

## images explained

Again if you decide to use an image its best to use images from <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org" target="_blank">Wikipedia Commons</a>

## Search Wikipedia Commons 

So if you want to include an image you will need to search for an image, for the 1969 date I searched "**Ray Tomlinson**" and got this result, in order to use this file click on the "Use this file on the web" and copy the **file URL** link so that you can use this later and include this image as an asset

## Create a new Date

We now need to add a new date, click the **add term** button just below your current date just under 1969 for this example I will call the new date 1971 and in that year the first email was sent by Ray Tomlinson at APRAnet in 1971

## Dates

Next we need to include the dates for this part of the timeline - in this case I'm going to use 1971 as the start and end date and because this part of the time line is about eMail I will use some heading with eMail in the title and also a brief piece of information about eMail for the bodytext.

You now should have something like this image.

## Assests

You can also include some **assets**, in this case I will include a media hyperlink that we copied earlier and we also will include credit to Wikipedia Commons

You now should have something like this image.

![assets](img/29.jpg)

## Reference

Were possible you should reference your work, in the body text of the asset I have used information from <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2015/01/02/a-very-short-history-of-the-internet-and-the-web-2/#3f08fd867a4e">this Website</a> and I have included that link in the body text as my source.

When you display the timeline you should be able to see something like the image below
