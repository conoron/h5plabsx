# lets get started

To view the Presentation component on the H5P website please follow the example link on the workshop page or click <a href="https://h5p.org/presentation" target="_blank">here</a>

## The Context

So for this presentation component I will use a timeline on the the Internet as an example, you may wish to use something else that is related to your own area of expertise. I will use some slide that I have developed from the presentation workshop.


## Log into Moodle

Log into Moodle <a href="http://conorpaul.com/moodle35" target="_blank">here</a>  and navigate to your sandbox area where you want to use the H5P Timeline component, at this stage we will start the process by adding the H5P Interactive Content type in Moodle.

## Adding the activity

I have decided to call the section **Timeline Example** but you may want to use some other name which is okay, select the Add an activity or resource option.

## Search and use the correct Interactive Component

A this stage you will start to build the H5P Interactive content. Select or search find the editor for the component you plan on using, in this case it the Timeline, so I have started the search for "time"

Now you should see the Timeline component select the *details* button
