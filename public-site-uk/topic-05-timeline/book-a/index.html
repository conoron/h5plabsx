</li>
</ol>
<h2>Next</h2>
<p>Move to step 01 in the lab</p>

          </div>
        
          <div class="ui tab segment lab" data-tab="01">
            <h1>lets get started</h1>
<p>To view the Presentation component on the H5P website please follow the example link on the workshop page or click <a href="https://h5p.org/presentation" target="_blank">here</a></p>
<h2>The Context</h2>
<p>So for this presentation component I will use a timeline on the the Internet as an example, you may wish to use something else that is related to your own area of expertise. I will use some slide that I have developed from the presentation workshop.</p>
<h2>Log into Moodle</h2>
<p>Log into Moodle <a href="http://conorpaul.com/moodle35" target="_blank">here</a>  and navigate to your sandbox area where you want to use the H5P Timeline component, at this stage we will start the process by adding the H5P Interactive Content type in Moodle.</p>
<h2>Adding the activity</h2>
<p>I have decided to call the section <strong>Timeline Example</strong> but you may want to use some other name which is okay, select the Add an activity or resource option.</p>
<p><img src="img/04.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2>Add in Interactive Content</h2>
<p>Now select the Interactive content type from the pop-up list</p>
<p><img src="img/05.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2>Search and use the correct Interactive Component</h2>
<p>A this stage you will start to build the H5P Interactive content. Select or search find the editor for the component you plan on using, in this case it the Timeline, so I have started the search for &quot;time&quot;</p>
<p>Now you should see the Timeline component select the <em>details</em> button </p>
<p><img src="img/03.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Now we can use this component now by selecting the &quot;use&quot; button</p>
<p><img src="img/06.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2>Next</h2>
<p>Move to step 02 in the lab</p>

          </div>
        
          <div class="ui tab segment lab" data-tab="02">
            <h1>Timeline context</h1>
<p>This screen is slightly more complicated then previous workshops screens, in this example we are going to build a timeline of the Internet so that the student can navigate through the timeline and see all the major dates that happen as part of the Internet, I will be using some slides that I prepared earlier (for the Presentation Workshop) and I will use those as my images.</p>
<h2>Settings explained</h2>
<p>On the screen we see a few part that we need to explain first before we continue, starting with the Title, which is the title the user will see on the H5P Activity screen. in this example I have called it &quot;<strong>Timeline of the Internet</strong>&quot;, we can also add a short introduction and if you like you can add an image, all of these will appear on the start screen for you timeline.</p>
<p><img src="img/06.jpg" alt="overall settings"></p>
<p>You now should have something like this image. </p>
<p><img src="img/07.jpg" alt="overall settings"></p>
<h2>images explained</h2>
<p>If you decide to use an image as an asset for a particular date then H5P is very rigid when it comes to using images, it is possible but from my experience its best to use images from <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org" target="_blank">Wikipedia Commons</a></p>
<p><img src="img/08.jpg" alt="images"></p>
<h2>Search Wikipedia Commons</h2>
<p>So if you want to include an image you will need to search for an image, I have searched for Licklider and got these results, I now need to click on the File resources for the image</p>
<p><img src="img/09.jpg" alt="search"></p>
<h2>How to use this file</h2>
<p>After you have clicked on the file resource now you have to get the <strong>File URL</strong> and you can get this by clicking ion the <em>Use this file</em> </p>
<p><img src="img/10.jpg" alt="get the file url"></p>
<p>Copy the file URL so that you can use this later and include this image as an asset</p>
<p><img src="img/11.jpg" alt="url for file"></p>
<h2>Dates</h2>
<p>Next we need to include the dates for this part of the timeline - in this case I&#39;m going to use 1962 as the start and end date and because this part of the time line is about JCR Licklider I will use some heading with JCR Licklider in the title and also a brief peice of information about JCR Licklder for the bodytext.</p>
<p><img src="img/12.jpg" alt="dates"></p>
<p>You now should have something like this image.</p>
<p><img src="img/13.jpg" alt="dates"></p>
<h2>Assests</h2>
<p>You can also include some <strong>assets</strong>, in this case I will include a media hyperlink that we copied earlier and we also will include credit to Wikipedia Commons</p>
<p><img src="img/14.jpg" alt="assets"></p>
<p>You now should have something like this image.</p>
<p><img src="img/15.jpg" alt="assets"></p>
<h2>Save changes and Test</h2>
<p>At this point we have out first date (1962) in place we should now save our changes and test, we might need to make changes.</p>
<p><img src="img/99.jpg" alt="save and test"></p>
<p>When you display the timeline you should be able to see something like the image below</p>
<p><img src="img/16.jpg" alt="save and test"></p>
<h2>Next</h2>
<p>Move to the next step</p>

          </div>
        
          <div class="ui tab segment lab" data-tab="03">
            <h1>Adding more dates</h1>
<p>We have already added in one date (1962) now we can add another date, this time we will add content for 1969 and this date will be about ARPAnet which was one of the founding research centers responsible for the development of the Internet.</p>
<h2>images explained</h2>
<p>Again if you decide to use an image as an asset for a particular date then H5P is very rigid when it comes to using images, it is possible but from my experience its best to use images from <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org" target="_blank">Wikipedia Commons</a></p>
<p><img src="img/08.jpg" alt="images"></p>
<h2>Search Wikipedia Commons</h2>
<p>So if you want to include an image you will need to search for an image, for the 1969 date I have searched ARPANET Log and got these results, I now need to click on the File resources for the image</p>
<p><img src="img/17.jpg" alt="search"></p>
<h2>How to use this file</h2>
<p>After you have clicked on the file resource now you have to get the <strong>File URL</strong> and you can get this by clicking ion the <em>Use this file</em> </p>
<p><img src="img/18.jpg" alt="get the file url"></p>
<p>Copy the file URL so that you can use this later and include this image as an asset</p>
<p><img src="img/19.jpg" alt="url for file"></p>
<h2>Create a new Date</h2>
<p>We now need to add a new date, click the <strong>add term</strong> button just below your current date, for this example I will call the new date 1969 you can use you own date or feel free to follow my example</p>
<p><img src="img/20.jpg" alt="new date"></p>
<h2>Dates</h2>
<p>Next we need to include the dates for this part of the timeline - in this case I&#39;m going to use 1969 as the start and end date and because this part of the time line is about ARPAnet I will use some heading with ARPAnet in the title and also a brief piece of information about ARPAnet for the bodytext.</p>
<p><img src="img/12.jpg" alt="new date"></p>
<p>You now should have something like this image.</p>
<p><img src="img/21.jpg" alt="new date"></p>
<h2>Assests</h2>
<p>You can also include some <strong>assets</strong>, in this case I will include a media hyperlink that we copied earlier and we also will include credit to Wikipedia Commons</p>
<p><img src="img/14.jpg" alt="assets"></p>
<p>You now should have something like this image.</p>
<p><img src="img/22.jpg" alt="assets"></p>
<h2>Reference</h2>
<p>Were possible you should reference your work, in the body text of the asset I have used information from <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2015/01/02/a-very-short-history-of-the-internet-and-the-web-2/#3f08fd867a4e">this Website</a> and I have included that link in the body text as my source. </p>
<p><img src="img/24.jpg" alt="source"> </p>
<h2>Save changes and Test</h2>
<p>At this point we have out second date (1969) in place we should now save our changes and test, we might need to make changes.</p>
<p><img src="img/99.jpg" alt="save and test"></p>
<p>When you display the timeline you should be able to see something like the image below</p>
<p><img src="img/23.jpg" alt="save and test"></p>
<h2>Next</h2>
<p>Move to the next step</p>

          </div>
        
          <div class="ui tab segment lab" data-tab="04">
            <h1>Adding more dates</h1>
<p>At this point we have two dates (1962) and (1969) in place, we will add an other date now and if you want to add a further dates its will be just a case of repeating this step taking in account what you have learner about sourcing images and also how to crete new dates.</p>
<h2>images explained</h2>
<p>Again if you decide to use an image its best to use images from <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org" target="_blank">Wikipedia Commons</a></p>
<p><img src="img/08.jpg" alt="images"></p>
<h2>Search Wikipedia Commons</h2>
<p>So if you want to include an image you will need to search for an image, for the 1969 date I searched &quot;<strong>Ray Tomlinson</strong>&quot; and got this result, in order to use this file click on the &quot;Use this file on the web&quot; and copy the <strong>file URL</strong> link so that you can use this later and include this image as an asset</p>
<p><img src="img/27.jpg" alt="search"></p>
<h2>Create a new Date</h2>
<p>We now need to add a new date, click the <strong>add term</strong> button just below your current date just under 1969 for this example I will call the new date 1971 and in that year the first email was sent by Ray Tomlinson at APRAnet in 1971</p>
<p><img src="img/25.jpg" alt="new date"></p>
<h2>Dates</h2>
<p>Next we need to include the dates for this part of the timeline - in this case I&#39;m going to use 1971 as the start and end date and because this part of the time line is about eMail I will use some heading with eMail in the title and also a brief piece of information about eMail for the bodytext.</p>
<p><img src="img/12.jpg" alt="new date"></p>
<p>You now should have something like this image.</p>
<p><img src="img/26.jpg" alt="new date"></p>
<h2>Assests</h2>
<p>You can also include some <strong>assets</strong>, in this case I will include a media hyperlink that we copied earlier and we also will include credit to Wikipedia Commons</p>
<p><img src="img/28.jpg" alt="assets"></p>
<p>You now should have something like this image.</p>
<p><img src="img/29.jpg" alt="assets"></p>
<h2>Reference</h2>
<p>Were possible you should reference your work, in the body text of the asset I have used information from <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2015/01/02/a-very-short-history-of-the-internet-and-the-web-2/#3f08fd867a4e">this Website</a> and I have included that link in the body text as my source. </p>
<p><img src="img/30.jpg" alt="source"> </p>
<h2>Save changes and Test</h2>
<p>At this point we have several dates (1992, 1969 and 1971) in place we should now save our changes and test, we might need to make changes.</p>
<p><img src="img/99.jpg" alt="save and test"></p>
<p>When you display the timeline you should be able to see something like the image below</p>
<p><img src="img/31.jpg" alt="save and test"></p>
