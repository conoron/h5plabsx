<h2>Next</h2>
<p>Move to step 01 in the lab</p>

          </div>
        
          <div class="ui tab segment lab" data-tab="01">
            <h1>lets get started</h1>
<p>To view the video component on the H5P website please follow the example link on the workshop page or click <a href="https://h5p.org/video" target="_blank">here</a></p>
<h2>The Context</h2>
<p>So for this this workshop, we are going to develop an interactive H5P video that we create in Moodle and we will include multiple choice and true or false type questions in the video, the video will stop playing at the question and will resume after the questions is answered.</p>
<h2>Log into Moodle</h2>
<p>Log into Moodle <a href="http://conorpaul.com/moodle35" target="_blank">here</a>  and navigate to your sandbox area where you want to use the H5P Video component, at this stage we will start the process by adding the H5P Interactive Content type in Moodle.</p>
<h2>Adding the activity</h2>
<p>I have decided to call the section <strong>Interactive Video</strong> but you may want to use some other name which is okay, select the Add an activity or resource option.</p>
<p><img src="img/04.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2>Add in Interactive Content</h2>
<p>Now select the Interactive content type from the pop-up list</p>
<p><img src="img/05.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2>Search and use the correct Interactive Component</h2>
<p>A this stage you will start to build the H5P Interactive content. Select or search find the editor for the component you plan on using, in this case use <strong>Video</strong></p>
<p>Now you should see the video component select the <em>details</em> button </p>
<p><img src="img/06.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Now we can use this component now by selecting the &quot;use&quot; button</p>
<p><img src="img/07.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2>Next</h2>
<p>Move to the next step </p>

          </div>
        
          <div class="ui tab segment lab" data-tab="02">
            <h1>Video context</h1>
<p>In this example we are going to build an interactive video and we will insert different questions into the video to make it stop for the students to answer the various questions, the video will resume play when the student answers the question at the point in the video.</p>
<h2>Settings explained</h2>
<p>On the screen we see a few setting that to explained first before we continue, 1. we must insert a title, 2, this is where you upload your video, 3. the interactions screen is where you add questions, hyperlinks, text etc. </p>
<p><img src="img/08.jpg" alt="overall settings"></p>
<h2>The Title</h2>
<p>Enter a title for this activity</p>
<p><img src="img/09.jpg" alt="title"></p>
<h2>The video</h2>
<p>You will have to upload a video, for this example i have used a royalty free video from <a href="https://www.pexels.com" target="_blank">pexels.com</a> You can use your own video or search for royalty free websites on the web.</p>
<h2>Upload the video</h2>
<p>Click on the add video location to upload you video, your screen will look like this when you upload the video, don&#39;t worry about the label for the quality for the video just take the default.</p>
<p><img src="img/10.jpg" alt="video"></p>
<h2>Interactions</h2>
<p>To add interactions click on the <strong>add interactions</strong> tab </p>
<p><img src="img/11.jpg" alt="add interactions"></p>
<h2>Different interactions</h2>
<p>As you can see from the image below I have 0:15 seconds into the video, the way interactions work is you can place interactions at any point in the video, so basically when you stop the video you can place an interaction at the point, so its could be a hyper-link to some resource, a multiple choice question, drag and drop activity, fill in the blanks etc. you have got to decide which interaction is appropriate to the content you are teaching to the students.</p>
<p><img src="img/12.jpg" alt="interactions"></p>

<p>Move to the next step</p>

          </div>
        
          <div class="ui tab segment lab" data-tab="03">
            <h1>Lets add some interactions</h1>
<h2>Video</h2>
<p>I am going to use <a href="https://www.pexels.com" target="_blank">this </a>video for ths example.</p>
<h2>Observations</h2>
<p>In this video I will base my interactions on observations, so I will ask the student questions like </p>
<ol>
<li>How may cars pass in the video?</li>
<li>How many of the cars were taxi&#39;s?</li>
<li>What colour pants was the first person walking left to right wearing?</li>
</ol>
<h2>1st observation</h2>
<p>My first observation takes place at 0:08 seconds, so stop the video at that time and select the multiple choice question type, also make sure you select 0:08 as the end time as well because if you dont the Tri this question label will remain in place until the end of the video.</p>
<p><img src="img/13.jpg" alt="multiple choice"></p>
<h2>Label</h2>
<p>Give the observation a label, at this stage we must pause the video so that the student has to try the question.</p>
<p><img src="img/14.jpg" alt="label"></p>
<h2>Title</h2>
<p>Give the observation a title</p>
<p><img src="img/15.jpg" alt="title"></p>
<h2>Question</h2>
<p>Fill in the question, I used &quot;What colour pants was the first person walking left to right wearing?&quot;</p>
<p><img src="img/16.jpg" alt="question"></p>
<h2>Options</h2>
<p>Fill in as many options as you like, these are the potential answers the student has to choose from in the multiple choice, I have started the first option with <strong>Red</strong> and I have indicated that is the correct answer, I can add other Option such <strong>Blank</strong> and <strong>Blue</strong></p>
<p><img src="img/17.jpg" alt="colour"></p>
<h2>Save your changes</h2>
<p>Make sure you save your changes now and test that everything works as expected, this is how the activity behalves, when the video is launched and we hit play at 0:08 seconds the video will stop and we are presented with the label we created earlier called <strong>Try this</strong> </p>
<p><img src="img/18.jpg" alt="save"></p>
<p>When the user plays the video from the Moodle screen they will see the following</p>
<p><img src="img/19.jpg" alt="try this"></p>
<p>When the student click on try this they are presented with the multiple choice question, they select there choice and check the results </p>
<p><img src="img/20.jpg" alt="result"></p>

            <h1>Add more interactions</h1>
<h2>Observations</h2>
<p>If you recall in the last step we were using this video for observations and we include a multiple choice question asking the students <strong>What colour pants was the first person walking left to right wearing?</strong>, Now we can add in tye further observations.</p>
<ol>
<li>How may cars pass in the street?</li>

<p><img src="img/24.jpg" alt="question"></p>
<h2>Save your changes</h2>
<p>Make sure you save your changes (save and display) now and test that everything works as expected, this is how the activity behalves, when the video is launched and we hit play at 0:08 seconds the video will stop and we are presented with the label we created earlier called <strong>Try this</strong> </p>
