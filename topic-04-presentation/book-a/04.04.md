## Add a blank image

On the question slide we just need a blank image, pr a blank background, so you have a couple of options, you can;

1. Upload a blank image like you did for the first question
2. You can leave the screen blank (don't upload any image)

For this example I am going to upload a blank image like we did for the first question type just to be consistent, so now you should have 4 slide and the 4th slide should be blank, again make sure you ajust the size of the image so it fit on the entire screen.

## Add the Question

After I placed the blank image on the slide I then used a **fill in the Blanks** question on the blank slide, I included the question "ARPAnet stand for Advanced *Research* *Projects* Agenct Network" this is actually classes as 2 questions in 1 because the student has to fill in 2 blanks.

The output will look like the following
