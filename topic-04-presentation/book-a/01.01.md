# lets get started

To view the Presentation component on the H5P website please follow the example link on the workshop page or click <a href="https://h5p.org/presentation" target="_blank">here</a>

## The Context

So for this presentation component I will use a presentation on the time-line of the Internet as an example, you may wish to use something elese that is related to your own area of expertise. We will develop some slides like a normal presentation however, the difference with this the H5P presentation is that it will have interactive elements such as multiple choice questions that engage the student.


## Log into Moodle

Log into Moodle <a href="http://conorpaul.com/moodle35" target="_blank">here</a>  and navigate to your sandbox area where you want to use the H5P flashcard component, at this stage we will start the process by adding the H5P Interactive Content type in Moodle.

## Adding the activity

I have decided to call the section Presentation example but you may want to use some other name which is okay, select the Add an activity or resource option.
