# Presentation context

This screen is slighty more complicated then previous workshops screens, what were are doing on the presentation setting screen is adding slides (images), this could be screenshots of the slide you covered in a lecture or they could be a summary version of toy slide you covered in a tutorial for example.

## Settings explained

On the screen we see a few part that we need to explain first before we continue, starting with the Title, which is the title the user will see on the Moodle page. in this example I have called it "Internet time-line".

##  Adding content to a slide

When you add a slide you then can add content to each slide via the options at the top of the screen, so you can add an image to your slide, you can add in a video, hyperlink, text, Multiple Choice Questions, fill in the blanks, true or false and more. For this example we will add in images and we will also add in some questions for interactivity and student engagement
