## The Context

So for this this workshop, we are going to develop an interactive H5P video that we create in Moodle and we will include multiple choice and true or false type questions in the video, the video will stop playing at the question and will resume after the questions is answered.


## Log into Moodle

Log into Moodle <a href="http://conorpaul.com/moodle35" target="_blank">here</a>  and navigate to your sandbox area where you want to use the H5P Video component, at this stage we will start the process by adding the H5P Interactive Content type in Moodle.

## Adding the activity

I have decided to call the section **Interactive Video** but you may want to use some other name which is okay, select the Add an activity or resource option.
