## Observations

If you recall in the last step we were using this video for observations and we include a multiple choice question asking the students **What colour pants was the first person walking left to right wearing?**, Now we can add in tye further observations.

1. How may cars pass in the street?
2. How many of the cars were taxi's?

## Next observation

My first observation takes place at 0:08 seconds, this observation will take place at 0:11 seconds
